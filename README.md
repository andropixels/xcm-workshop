# XCM Workshop

This is an interactive workshop walking your through Polkadot's XCM (cross-consensus messages) and
XCMP (cross-chain message passing).

The XCM implementation is built on top of many layers of abstractions and configurations. In order
to understand how XCM works, you will need to jump between the XCM format, the XCM Executor, XCM
Builder, XCM Configuration and more!

This workshop will walk you through those points and peel the layers of the onion.

We will focus on the 3 main types of balance transfers:

* A simple single chain transfer initiated by a parachain.
* A reserve backed transfer from the relay chain to a parachain.
* A teleport transfer from the relay chain to a trusted system chain.

## Contributing

This workshop was designed for the Sub0 Developer Conference taking place Oct 13-14 of 2021.

Substrate, Polkadot, XCM, and XCMP are all quickly developing products, and as such, documentation
can go out of date.
