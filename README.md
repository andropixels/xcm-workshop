# XCM Workshop

This is an interactive workshop walking your through Polkadot's XCM (cross-consensus messages) and

## Contributing

This workshop was designed for the Sub0 Developer Conference taking place Oct 13-14 of 2021.

Substrate, Polkadot, XCM, and XCMP are all quickly developing products, and as such, documentation
can go out of date.
